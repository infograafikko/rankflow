For every state, weâ€™ve broken down the population in two ways. <strong>You can now see two views for each state</strong>: where people who live in a state were born, or where people who were born in a state have moved to. The ribbons are color-coded by region, and foreign-born residents are included at the bottom, in gray, to complete the picture for each state.</p>\n\n<p>Migration can reveal the dynamism of a stateâ€™s economy or a cultural renaissance; a significant outflow can reveal the opposite. You'll also see the interrelationship between moving in and moving out -- in many states with heavy in-migration, native residents are more likely to stay than in states with less inflow.
